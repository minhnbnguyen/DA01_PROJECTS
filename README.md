# Project 3: RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation 👯‍♂️

💫 This project implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary value) analysis to segment customers into 10 groups based on their purchasing behavior, using a 5-point scoring system for each RFM dimension.

🚴‍♀️ How I implement this project using [SQL](https://github.com/minhnbnguyen/Project_3_RFM_and_Segmentation_Analysis/blob/main/Project3_RFM_segmentation_analysis.sql) queries   
🔶 Clean the raw data: convert to suitable data types, check null value, adding new columns for analysis, clean the outliers  
🔶 Perform ad-hoc analysis to explore the data: month with highest revenue, which product line has the most sale, etc.  
🔶 Determine the best customers by using RFM analysis  

🌱 What I accomplished in this project:  
🔹 Executed sophisticated statistical analyses in a PostgreSQL database, segmenting customers into 10 distinct categories based on behavior; insights directly influenced marketing strategies, optimizing ad spend allocation and improving ROI  
🔹 Transformed sales insights into visualization using Tableau; enhanced understanding of customer preferences and engagement behaviors across diverse segments
